It took a gossamer breath, soaked in syrup  
for the sputtering of flame, or  
to spell words on frosted glass  
that might fit on a shard that  
impales a pulp of heart  
so they may bleed and live.  
These whispers crawled to me,  
and were pocketed while sending  
blows to the hip as forceful as to the soul,  
caging the heart in secret scrawls  
where at least the o’s pour blood,  
and the center of x’s throb,  
although shy from my stares.
