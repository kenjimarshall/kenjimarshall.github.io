I had no friends. I’d moved to Japan two years ago, and every social attempt I made was met, in words or actions, with the sentiment that I was a cultural outsider. Even at Kyoto International School it didn’t make a difference. I came in the middle of grade nine, dropping into a world of impenetrable cliques like a paratrooper going into war. For most, this would be a problem, but for me it was okay. I embraced my label and accepted the loneliness that accompanied it. I liked seeing everything from the outside, as it allowed me to see more than everyone else, like a child watching an ant colony from above, gaining omniscience in little ways. It also allowed me to notice the other people on the fringes of society that nobody else does; misery loves company, they say.

The lunch hour was when that idea crystallized. For most, it was the epitome of community, but for me, it was supreme loneliness. The cafeteria was filled with the buzzing of conversation, but it was a sound I never contributed to. I heard snippets of dialogue here and there, and sometimes I pretended that they were directed toward me to feign normalcy, but it was a conversation I never actually joined, nor wanted to join. I was comfortable at my empty table, with the chairs all removed except my own to make room at more exciting places. I liked to sit back, eat my food, listen to the distant conversations, and stare at Ava Mars.

Ava Mars was as much a part of the wallpaper to everyone else as she was my entire world. She was the only other person with an empty table, and the only other person that could keep her mouth shut for as long as I could. I couldn’t help but stare. Everyday she sat down at 12:10 and got up at 1:00. When she sat down to eat, she tucked her hair behind her right ear. Everyday she ate her potatoes first, then her vegetables, then her chicken. She cut the chicken, put her knife down, then ate the slices with her fork. She drank water, taking measured sips every seven minutes. She ate mechanically without skipping a beat, and without a wasted motion. I could recall her features with infallible accuracy; her hazel eyes were unusually large yet sharp, her black hair dangled above her eyes with immaculate straightness, and her skin was as pale and unblemished as newly-fallen snow. She was beautiful. She filled the barren, lonely garden of my heart with a little sapling I called love. And since no one took notice of her, I lapped up the privilege of my observation every day.

On November 16th, I began my visual feast as I would any other day, but Ava Mars was staring right back at me. She’d deviated from her routine for the first time—an occurrence I’d considered impossible. Her eyes were colder than I’d remembered, and they seemed to see into my mind—to perceive my putrescence. Locked into each other, my heart beat wildly and my blood raced frenetically through my veins. This was a moment I’d dreamed of but never prepared for, and I was utterly bewildered. And then, as soon as it had begun, it was over. She was magnetically drawn back into her routine, and everything continued as any other day would, and yet the glassy perfection of the lunch hour had been cracked wide open. That day, Ava Mars left the lunch hall at 1:02.

After school, as I was walking back home, Ava Mars was standing on the corner. With a voice soft as velvet and smooth as eggshells she said “Come with me.”

“Where?”

“Come.” Ava didn’t say another word as she led me through a maze of streets. Cobblestone clicked beneath our feet, and the city of Kyoto seemed to be taking an early evening nap. We were the only ones there, silhouetted by the gentle glow of streetlamps as we walked side by side in silence. We arrived at an abandoned warehouse, complete with rusted metal and patchwork doors. Inside, it was decorated with a tawdry couch in front of a stained coffee table, along with a bed and a television. She sat down on the couch and stared at me.

“What’s your name?” She whispered.

“Arlo.”

“Why do you look at me?” She stared into my eyes persistently.

“Because no one else does.” Something seemed to flutter behind her icy cold visage. She tilted her head to the side as if puzzled, still staring into my eyes. She hadn’t blinked this entire conversation.

“No one’s supposed to notice me,” she muttered under her breath.

“I am no one,” I replied. She bent her head down, as if in despair. I sat down beside her and stared at her hunched frame. I slowly slid my arm over her shoulders, but as I contacted her skin I couldn’t help but recoil; it was cold as arctic water and felt dead as a metallic sheet. She noticed my reaction, and got up from the couch.

“The Electric Man doesn’t like it when I have people over. You should go.”

“The Electric Man?” I retorted.

She held my gaze for a second then said “I’ll walk you out.”

We walked in silence out of the warehouse, into a street now bathed in moonlight. Her composure softened as we stood outside. “You don’t have to be so lonely, Arlo. You can just come back here and talk to The Electric Man.”

I furrowed my brow. Is she crazy? “Okay,” I offered. I lingered by her side for a few moments more, then made my farewells and departed. That night, I dreamt of The Electric Man. He was dressed in a sapphire blue suit with jet black hair. Where his eyes should have been, were pits of darkness that seemed to have no end. Cradled in his hands was a hooked cane that shot lightning from its end. He was electrocuting Ava Mars, and she was smiling.

The next day, Ava Mars looked at me again. Her eyes weren’t as cold—only curious. She left the lunch hall at 1:05.

On my way home, she was waiting at the corner again. She didn’t say a word, but just started walking; I followed her, supposing we were heading to the warehouse. When we arrived, we sat on the couch and she asked me questions, interrogating my humanity.

“Are you happy?” she asked. “What gives you joy? Why do people smile when they’re so sad inside? What does life mean to you? What does it mean to be human? What gives you purpose?” She pressed me with fervor, imploring me to respond to each of her queries. She seemed desperate.

I answered each of her questions as well as I could, but, for the most part, these were questions I didn’t have the answer to—no one would have the answers she seeks. “Why do you want to know these things?” I finally asked her, as she was getting more and more frustrated at my incompetence.

With quivering composure, she said “because that’s what The Electric Man wants me to find out.” We stared at each other for a long time. Then, unable to stop myself, I kissed her. Cosmic thunderbolts struck my heart, the sonorous gong. Her lips were hard, icy, and unforgiving, freezing my blood over, and yet my skin buzzed with energy. I withdrew, and, confused, started to make my way out of the warehouse. She followed me, her face twitching, as if in contact with an electric fence.

“Why did you do that?” she said, quiet but unmistakable. “The Electric Man won’t like that.” I kept walking away, and she kept following me. I emerged onto the Kyoto streets. “Why?” she called after me, still on my tail. I walked across the street, starting to head back home. That’s when I heard a boom, a crackle, and the street burst into light. I screamed and shielded my eyes. When I opened them, I saw Ava Mars’ face, like a mask, laying on the street before me. I turned around, and I saw a truck, driving remorseless into the distance. And I also saw wires. Where there should have been blood, there was only circuitry; electronic guts, spilled across the street. Beneath her porcelain skin were smooth, metallic muscles. Where her face once was, there was a blank platinum sheet with a hole where her mouth was, and little strands of wiring where her eyes were. Ava Mars was never real. The only person I’d ever loved wasn’t real. The dam that held back the ocean of loneliness collapsed, and the black foaming sea surged through my veins. I stumbled back home, fell onto my bed, and sobbed my way into a slumber. I dreamed of The Electric Man. He was shocking me now, and I was so happy. I was laughing, and I hadn’t laughed for years.

The next day, I didn’t go to school, and I went to Ava Mars’ warehouse instead. Her remains had disappeared, and the street was as clean as it had ever been. I entered and was enveloped by silence. The couch was still there, along with the coffee table and the computer, but they looked sad and meaningless without Ava Mars beside them.

“I’m looking for The Electric Man,” I called out. Nothing. “Ava Mars said if I was lonely I could come to you.” The darkness shifted, and I could see a form crouching. I approached him, and as I came near, he stood up, and took a step into the light. He was just as I’d dreamed. Where his eyes should have been were two abyss-like pits, and his sapphire suit glimmered in contrast with his hair. He turned around and began to walk away. He didn’t say anything, but I knew he wanted me to follow him. He led me into a back room, filled with two metal tables, and surrounded by walls covered with electronic equipment and tools. On one table lay Ava Mars. Her face had been reattached to her body, and though the wiring was still in disarray and was poking out from different points on her skin, she was coming back together. I lay on the other table. He didn’t have to say anything; I knew what was going to happen from here on out. The Electric Man leaned over me—his empty eye sockets seemed to stare straight through me. He held a scalpel in one hand and a wire in another. I grinned wildly. This is what I wanted. The answers to Ava’s questions were all here; there is no purpose. We’re all just wearing masks, so why not tear that mask off and leave your humanity behind along with it? Why not? He put his hand over my heart, and everything went black.

The next day, Arlo Westland and Ava Mars left the lunch hall at 1:00, side by side, without a word to be said.
