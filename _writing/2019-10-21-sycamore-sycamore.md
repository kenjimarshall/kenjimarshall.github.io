_**Gone Underground**_

I tucked myself beneath my bed, occupying my mind with the dusty clusters and clumps of cotton, protruding in obscure patterns from the bottom of the mattress. Sometimes I just needed somewhere to go. People saw the underbellies of mattresses in context—hiding in moments of fear, flipped upside down while moving, or transiently during item retrieval. I was here for that underbelly alone. I figured something unorthodox would help me think about things in a new way. But I just felt as if I was turning over the night sky in my hands, looking at it from every angle and met with unimpregnable blackness.

I gave it ten more minutes before giving up and rolling myself free. It was morning on a summer Tuesday, and the air was blurry with humidity. I didn’t have anything to do until evening at which point, as always, I would go underground.

The first time I’d gone, it was the night my girlfriend and I broke up. She cheated on me with someone she met at a bar and told me. I told her it was over. This wasn’t because I was angry, but because it felt like a natural demarcation point. Every relationship has an underlying rhythm to it, moving in ebbs and flows. When she told me what happened, it may have been the tone of her voice or the position of her body, but I could feel the underlying currents drying up beneath us. If we’d stayed together it would have been like swimming in sand.

I didn’t want to go home, so I wandered the streets until I stumbled on the entrance to a tunnel. There was a big steel door with a full suite of bolts and latches, but all were undone and hanging limply. It used to be a service entrance to the subway, but now it was abandoned due to structural integrity issues, waiting to be filled in. It was unusual that it was unlocked; they’d originally sealed it up with an impressive assemblage of security mechanisms to fend off curious passersby. Seeing them all limp and helpless felt like something I wasn’t meant to see, like dried up tears on smiling cheeks. I went in.

The subway tracks were on a bed of gravel, but the abandonment had persisted long enough for patches of moss to aggregate on the rails and on the crumbling, white brick walls. When I closed the door, the subway remained doused in anemic, yellow lights, filtered through clumps of dust and cobwebs. The tunnel was deathly quiet, save the whispers of hollowness, and the unobtrusive humming of lights. I started to walk, and the crunch of gravel echoed through the entire tunnel, pushing the orderly stillness slightly toward chaos. I walked on for what must have been an hour, lulled into a trance by the subterranean homogeny. When I saw the girl, I could barely breathe. My hands tingled.

The first thing I saw were her feet, bare and beaten, bleeding from beneath her toenails and caked with dirt and rock. The dirt smeared up her legs in streaks, eventually being lost beneath the edge of a dress, which seemed to have been white before being defiled by the underground. Her head was cradled in tendrils of mud, crawling up her neck. She swallowed, wet and loud. Staring at her face, I was struck by the delicacy of her features. Beneath the grime was a face sculpted with smooth, elegant lines. Every feature seemed woven together upon a lush valley of olive skin without an ill-placed crease or wrinkle. The swell of her forehead cruised into a beautiful diminution between the eye and nose, cresting again in a shapely cheekbone before curving down into a soft, sloping jawline. Every millimeter felt meticulously crafted. Smoldering hazel eyes peered beneath slanted eyebrows.

She was standing with her arms pressed against the small of her back. I extended my palms toward her, and she stared down at my hands with caution. Slowly, she began to move her arms from behind her.

That was how I met Anya.

_**Anya**_

Anya’s mom cut her tongue out when she was five. The ‘why’ was never something understood by Anya or even her mother. But Anya was too young to question what was happening. That tongue’s last task was screaming, but Anya didn’t fight back very much. She even felt bad for screaming so much at the time. That night she sobbed silently with blood dripping from her gums into her bedsheets. Some part of her knew this was an _unnatural loss_, but most of her felt sad and guilty—she’d made things so hard for her mom, and now she was staining her sheets. These feelings clutched to her. Kids have sticky hearts.

She started to be interested in music. The piano felt like a way she could communicate, and so she took to it with abandon. The pain she felt manifested in her musical style; severed from the world around her, Anya yearned to make her music speak as much as possible. She would silently moan and gasp, and push language into the keys beneath her. The result was spellbinding. A single phrase became a story, evoking tears and grins within the same breath—Anya wove musical notes together like a masterful orator, translating notes on a page to her own abstract language. Each note was precisely pulled from some higher-dimensional space of possibilities to communicate something precise, and genuine. Anya could make Chopin sickening, Schoenberg sonorous. She toured internationally by 9, selling out the best concert halls in the world. All the money went to her mother, but Anya didn’t even think about that. Piano was all she had.

But as she grew older, the things she wanted to say became more complex, and that convoluted musical language she had concocted was no longer enough for her. Her performances became aimless and confused. Once she became visibly frustrated and punched the piano cover over and over until her knuckles bled in front of a stunned audience. When the money stopped flowing in, Anya’s mother punished her. Locking Anya in a room with the piano, she would make little cuts on her back every time she made a mistake or played things in a way that wasn’t beautiful. Anya barely slept; she would stay awake, staring into the mirror with her mouth gaping, trying with her entire body to scream—but sound wouldn’t come to accompany her body’s violent twists and convulsions. Those days ended with her weeping silently until her body collapsed from fatigue.

Anya’s neighbor was a wiry teenager with a curly mess of jet black hair that lived next door. She noticed him watching her; the subtle shift of his bedroom curtain was one clue, and the glimpses of those clustered locks sealed the deal. When Anya’s mom went out to run errands, Anya slipped out and approached him on his porch. He watched her come near, shifting from foot to foot, probably nervous Anya would confront him. She came to a stop right in front of him.

‘Hey,’ he muttered.

His voice was deeper than she imagined. And smooth. Like ocean currents. He looked at his feet and back up.

‘I’m Reza’ he offered in an attempt to break the awkward silence.

Reza. It was a strange name.

Anya walked up his porch steps and sat down next to him. Reza watched her steadily. Eventually understanding that she wasn’t going to say anything, he relaxed and welcomed the taciturn company. As time went on, the air between them began to feel pregnant with a distinct sense of mutual understanding. Anya had never felt this before, and although she was only there for five minutes, she soaked up every piece of Reza that she could extract from the air around her. After she’d left, those pieces of Reza that lingered on were pulsing and glowing like embers. Human connection became her addiction, and she spent every moment alone with him. She hoped and begged that she could lose all of herself and gain all of him. The fact that Anya couldn’t speak never seemed to be an issue. The two of them didn’t have much to talk about after all.

As time went on, Anya grew stronger with more energy and vitality, but Reza’s eyes began to dull. The power of their connection became weaker, and it was as if there was something special inside Reza that Anya had siphoned. She began to understand this, but even then nothing could stop her. He barely spoke, his eyelids drooped, his lips were grey and sagged.

But Anya was better than ever. She’d found herself in those pieces of Reza, and she started to play piano more. Hidden between those runs and chords, Anya found new words, and this breathed life into her performances. All the while she kept seeing Reza, even if he just laid there with eyes closed. She wanted every last drop.

With Reza fueling her, she was booked to perform at an internationally acclaimed music festival as a guest pianist. They often tried to incorporate experimental interpretation and young performers, and Anya existed firmly at this intersection. This was one of the bigger festivals in the world, and so Anya’s mother grew increasingly intense in preparation.

The night before, as Anya lay in bed, her mother crept into her room and perched herself above Anya’s face, knees tucked into her chest—discolored, veiny skin shining and oily beneath streams of moonlight. She craned her neck down, and her head swooped to within an inch of Anya’s face. Her eyes were solemn and unblinking. Her skin trembling. The silence was deafening. As if pulled by a macabre puppet-master, the corners of her mouth broke into a smile, widening like a fleshy incision being drawn upon her wrinkled cheek. The eyes didn’t change. The trembles became more violent, like some creature was trying to push itself out of her head, through that thin, crescent-shaped mouth, those glazed, disc-like eyes. And then she swooped out of the room, like some dastardly, bipedal bat. Goodnight.

It was the next day, and Anya had gotten ready for the performance; she kept things simple, with a smattering of blush and a girlish white dress. In the approaching hours, as her flight drew near, thoughts of Reza swelled. Anya crept out of her home; her mother sat stiffly in the kitchen, like a dead body in rigor mortis. She snuck into Reza’s room, through his window. Anya was there to take whatever he had left. But when she came near, his eyes snapped open with intensity she’d thought was long gone. His mouth curled into a snarl, and he brutally swung his arm, clobbering Anya to the ground. His body moved imprecisely but fueled with impossible ferocity. He leapt on top of her, pummeling his knees into her chest with his entire body’s weight, completely shattering Anya’s ribs. He grabbed her neck, while he heaved out rough, guttural moans, squeezing until Anya’s windpipe was completely constricted. His face was drenched in sweat. His hair, now thin and sickly, was matted on his forehead. From his back pocket, he pulled out a hammer, and without hesitation slammed it into Anya’s right hand, completely breaking every bone within. Anya couldn’t scream, she just watched helplessly, as blood, flesh and bone leaked out. Reza went again, and again, pummeling her hand until it was deformed into an unrecognizable pulp. He released his grip on her neck for a split second so she could breathe, and then clamped down even tighter than before. He moved to the other hand, forming a constellation of fractures, then a soup of bony shrapnel in boiling blood. When he was done, he let go and stared at her. Anya wept silently, lapsing in and out of consciousness. Eventually, he picked her up, carried her outside, and mechanically deposited her in her backyard.

_**A Door Opens**_

It was quiet now. Unseen, the back of Anya’s mother buckled, and her head drooped onto the kitchen table. Unseen, Reza cleaned his hammer. Anya lay limp in the shadow of a sycamore.

**From a hidden room within, we find a couplet inscribed on cream-coloured walls.**

_Sycamore, sycamore,  
I don’t want to feel sick anymore._

These things were unseen but felt, Anya reborn from the maternal vice, wrought from the strokes of a hammer. The sycamore creaked within a fragrant summer breeze, and birds giggled and chirped. It smelled like magnolia.

_Through it all, a smile grew,  
After all, this room knows you._

Although she had nowhere to go, she hoisted herself up, and ambled toward that place we expect. She left a trail of herself, in blood, flesh and bone. At that entrance we’ve seen, there was a worker removing graffiti on the front of the door. Anya moved toward him, gesturing at the entrance with her mangled limbs. Nervous to protest, he unlocked the bolts and latches with trembling hands, and Anya walked right in, down to that place we met.

_**A Chance Encounter**_

I held her arms in mine.

‘How did this happen?’

In response she held my right hand between her forearms and guided it over her shoulder to the zipper on the back of her dress. She nodded her head in its direction.

‘You want me to take this off?’

She nodded minutely.

I wasn’t in a place to ask questions, and so I obliged, pulling her zipper down. The mud-caked dress stuck to her skin, and I had to peel it off. Her back was covered in scabbing scars, like a nighttime sky full of stars. Her ribs were covered in a patch of bluish-purple, and as I looked closer at her body, I saw the stark imprint of thumbs on the front of her neck. Looking up, we stared at each-other and I felt, for the first time, a sense of fate. A chance encounter in a place like this could not be a product of luck. I came here because I had nothing else. I could’ve come down here to die, for all I knew. But with this girl before me, I felt a door swing open somewhere new and unseen.

_A door creaks, the room speaks._

We can help each-other, those eyes said. How they did, I do not know.

_**Treatments**_

Her wounds were in bad shape—a yellowing battleground of lymphocytes. When I returned to her, I brought a suite of medical supplies down to the tunnels. I scrubbed her body with soap and water, teasing away the mud and dirt. I rubbed alcohol on her back, sterilizing the cuts, and to ease the swelling in her ribs and neck, I sat with her head in my lap and iced her for hours. To stop the bleeding at her hands, I used a lighter and cauterized her exposed flesh, then I wrapped gauze with disinfectant cream around any part that was hurt and changed the bandages whenever I could. I made tuna sandwiches and brought canteens of ice water so we would eat and drink until we were stuffed. I stole simple clothes from my mom’s wardrobe to help her; sweatpants and a Beatles sweatshirt with extra underwear and undershirts.

After I’d done what I could, she led me to a clump of weeds. I watched her, painstakingly but with determination, pull slivers of from between the gravel. With unwavering intensity, she arranged those slivers into a pattern before me. I watched letters take shape, until form emerged: Anya.

It was a name that moves from the front of your mouth to the back, only to surge forward and spill from your lips—that can be paused and held in space, between tongue and tooth, or hidden on the wall of your throat. I whispered it out loud, over and over, until my mouth had mastered the movement. Anya.

She led me to the train tracks. _Lie down_. I did as she wanted, across the wooden slats. There were no trains coming, but my palms still got sweaty. I rested my fingertips on the metal rails surrounding me, becoming familiar with my new environment. Anya laid down next to me. _Close your eyes_. I did.

I didn’t feel anything for a while. I thought about the bottoms of beds, with their cotton clumps. As I waited, those clumps morphed from something abstract to take form, like clouds that, in a moment of clarity, become something unmistakable. Like a leopard, or a sword. From across the mattress, the cotton tufts blobbed together—a crackling, amorphous mass. The air felt pregnant with expectation, and the mass shivered faintly, on the verge of dividing. As I watched with increasing interest, I felt Anya rest her head on my chest.

_**Jade Carpet, Cream Walls**_

Suddenly, my mind was taken somewhere else, away from that mattress. I opened my eyes and saw a green rug beneath my toes. It was lush and tufted, individual bits of wool poking between my toes like treetops poking above the rainforest canopy. It formed a strip down the middle of pale, sugary oak flooring, and cream-colored walls. It was a long hallway, completely barren. At the end, there was a white door, with a brass doorknob.

I moved toward it, feeling my toes squish into the rug, and the walls moving alongside me. But that door didn’t get any closer. I felt Anya pressed against me, her body shivering. Whatever was behind that door was important, that was something I knew instinctively. The edges of the door frame gave me no hints, and the door remained impossibly far. Before I could reach it, I felt Anya’s head slip from my chest onto the tracks beside me. She had collapsed beside me, obviously worn out from fatigue. I moved her body off the tracks, resting it against the walls of the tunnel. It was clear that I had to leave. I turned back the way I came, and wandered home. Emerging onto the street, beneath midnight blue, I heard the strained whisper of that door from somewhere far away.

_Shadowed streets beneath lazuli blue,  
The underground hides pieces of you_

But this was something I already knew.

_**Doorknobs That Don’t Break**_

The ensuing visits followed the same pattern. I would bring Anya supplies, treat her, feed her, and then she would try to get me into that room. However, no matter how hard I tried, Anya wasn’t getting better. Her wounds had been infected, and the flesh down her back and up her forearms was necrotizing. No matter what I did, I felt like I couldn’t stop it. And I couldn’t reach that door, no matter what. I had gotten better; by focusing every ounce of energy, I’d ventured closer closer. But the door remained beyond an arm’s grasp—beyond many arms. And time was running out.

Tonight I was going to go down again. Anya was dying after all. I loaded up with alcohol swabs, gauze, disinfectant cream, over-the-counter painkillers, and anything else I could grab—tuna sandwiches and water as well. I moved with practiced strides to that place we’d met so many times before. Looking around I couldn’t see her; it was as if she’d been swallowed by the gravel. After a few more careful sweeps, I saw a glimmer of skin—an ankle! Anya was curled up in a ball within a dark patch along the wall of the tunnel. That ankle caught the edge of light, drifting lazily from those anemic lamps. I rushed to her and rolled her on her back. Her eyes were cloudy and directionless; her mouth drooled globs of blood. Unfurled from a ball, her body shivered and I felt streaks of cold sweat down her shoulders. I stripped off her bandages revealing forearms colored in a mélange of black and yellow.

I sprung to action, slipping a painkiller into her mouth. I grabbed an alcohol swab and ran it up and down her arms. I felt her body tense and shudder with each stroke. I wrapped her arms in fresh bandages with new cream. All the while I looked into her eyes; occasionally, I saw a weak flicker from beneath the murk.

“Anya”, I whispered—another flicker from somewhere deep inside, like a candle behind fog.

I finished what I could do and looked over her. I’d never seen someone this vulnerable. I felt confronted with mortality, like I’d lifted away a veil atop some squirming, tremulous mite. It was so weak and powerless. How could it avoid being stomped into the ground?

But through it all, she crawled forward, heaving herself with her blackened arms toward the train tracks. Wordlessly, I aligned myself between them. Slowly but surely, Anya crawled over to me, bringing her head to my heart.

And once again, there was that carpeted hallway, with sugary oak and cream-colored walls. The brass doorknob gleamed like an impish eye. I started to pump my legs, but it felt like running in a chest-high sea of molasses. I kept pumping against that unforgiving, dense slime until I could feel clumps of it disbanding, like ants tumbling down the sides of a hill. One more jolt of energy sent me tumbling toward that doorknob, and with a deft twist, the door swung open with unnerving smoothness. I was inside.

_**What We Look For**_

The verdure of the carpet, beyond the door precipice, blossomed and widened, engulfing the floor until forming a plush, moss-like underpinning for those cream-colored walls, and in the center, something else. From the bottom, a sleek, matte black prism is observed. It grows out of the rug like a charred tree trunk, whittled from chaos into pristine geometric form. By tracing those sharp lines up its body, we find their conclusion beneath a pyramid of crimson-stained glass. The glass is veiny, with spindly, dark grey lines crawling along its exterior. They obscure what’s inside and seem to pulse in a cardiac rhythm.

I walked toward the structure, and my toes brushed something cold and hard. It was a hammer, nestled within the carpet blades, lying just in front of the pyramid. The hammer was also exquisite, boasting glimmering black like polished obsidian. I reached down and held it in my hands. It was heavy, but well-balanced. It felt good to wield, and promptly encouraged destruction when, without thinking, I slammed it down into the pyramid. I could still feel Anya on my chest, holding on with energy I thought had been long extinguished. The pyramid shattered easily, and I felt shards of glass brush against my skin, lodging themselves into my stomach, chest, and cheek. Crimson gel spilled from the pyramid, oozing down the prism and pooling in the folds of the carpet below. I watched it crawl over my toes—it was hot and sticky. I looked back at the pedestal to see what the pyramid was hiding, beneath its veins and fluids. In the center, proudly hoisted upon a metallic skewer was a tongue, dripping saliva and blood. Anya collapsed.

It was dark, but I felt the familiar cold touch of the metal railway beneath me, and the ridges of the wooden slats pressed into my back. I felt a wisp of breath brush against my ear. It was Anya. And then there was a voice, soft and fragile, like a cracked butterfly wing buffeted by summer wind:

**(Part I: The Mechanism)**

_Sycamore, sycamore,  
I don’t want to feel sick anymore._

_Shadowed streets beneath lazuli blue,  
The underground holds pieces of you.  
Crushed to sand, ground to dust,  
Flesh and bone, built for lust,  
Dirt and rock, borne from us._

_Roots like tongues that lap you up,  
Slime and slough spill from the cup._

**(Part II: The Messenger)**

_The best coffins have white doors,  
Jade carpet, cream walls, otherwise unadorned._

_A door creaks,  
The room speaks._

_What’s yours to lose is there to take,  
To burn and bury, bend and break,  
It strips the skin—the flesh it sands,  
With surgeon’s speed and practiced hands._

_Through it all, a smile grew,  
After all, this room knows you._

I tried to speak, but I couldn’t. That’s good. I smiled to myself.

A door closed somewhere far away.
