The river flows beyond the reach of sun,  
Phlegmatically beneath its foaming skin,  
Polluted with the scraps of dreams undone,  
And tracing out a sickly path to sin.

In twilit hours as purple fades to black,  
The current grips the heart and starts to pull  
You too a place from which you canâ€™t come back,  
Where hearts are empty shells and minds are full.

And those you leave ashore are left alone,  
To stare into the bruised and murky brook,  
With shaky breaths in face of the unknown,  
Like grass atop a windy overlook.

So raise your oars and fight against the flow;  
Resist against the fading of the glow.
